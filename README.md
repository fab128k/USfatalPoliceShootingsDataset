# USfatalPoliceShootingsDataset
In 2020 protests born in 2015 after the death of Michael Brown have sharpened exponentially after the killing by American police of George Floyd. From 1 January 2015 the Washington Post holds a database of violent deaths by police in the US territory in the line of duty.

The data contain many details of the killing such as name of the victims, date of the event, race, age, gender, armed or not, etc..

The Washington Post collected this information from law enforcement websites, new local reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as "Killed by Police" and "Fatal Dating". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases.

An analysis of empirical data can help to understand whether the protests are founded and therefore whether the attitude of the American police towards ethnic minorities is subject to bias.
